# Photo Album with Cloud Storage Integration

## Overview
This project is a Django-based photo album application that migrates your local photo album to cloud storage (e.g., AWS S3) for handling media files. It demonstrates how to configure external storage, update your image upload and display logic, and secure media access with proper permissions. This project is designed with beginner-friendly instructions to help you understand cloud integration with Django.

## Key Features
- **Cloud Storage Integration:** Configure Django to work with external storage services such as AWS S3.
- **Image Upload & Display:** Seamlessly upload images and display them by fetching from the cloud.
- **Media Security:** Implement secure access to media files with appropriate permissions.
- **Beginner-Friendly:** Clear documentation and setup instructions tailored for newcomers.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
Before getting started, ensure you have:
- **Python 3.8+**
- **Django** (latest version recommended)
- **Boto3** and **django-storages** (for AWS S3 integration)
- An **AWS account** (or another cloud provider with similar services)

### Installation
1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/photo-album-cloud.git
   cd photo-album-cloud
2. Create a Virtual Environment and Activate It:

```bash
python3 -m venv env
source env/bin/activate   # On Windows: env\Scripts\activate
```

3. Install Dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

4. Configure AWS S3 Settings: Update your Django settings (settings.py) with your AWS S3 credentials and configuration:

```python
# settings.py
AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID = 'your-access-key-id'
AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY = 'your-secret-access-key'
AWS_STORAGE_BUCKET_NAME = 'your-bucket-name'
AWS_S3_CUSTOM_DOMAIN = f'{AWS_STORAGE_BUCKET_NAME}.s3.amazonaws.com'
AWS_S3_OBJECT_PARAMETERS = {
    'CacheControl': 'max-age=86400',
}

DEFAULT_FILE_STORAGE = 'storages.backends.s3boto3.S3Boto3Storage'
MEDIA_URL = f'https://{AWS_S3_CUSTOM_DOMAIN}/'
```

5. Run Migrations and Start the Server:

```bash
python manage.py migrate
python manage.py runserver
```

## Usage
- Uploading Images: Use the image upload page in your browser to upload photos. All images will be stored in your configured cloud storage.

- Viewing Images: The app displays your photos by fetching them securely from the cloud.

- Security: Media access is protected via configured permissions, ensuring only authorized users can view your files.

## Deployment
For production deployment:

- Use a production-grade server like Gunicorn.

- Securely manage environment variables for your AWS credentials.

- Configure proper CORS settings and bucket policies in AWS S3.
